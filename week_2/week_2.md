## Problem 1
Write down what each of the following pieces of code prints out. If there is an error in the code, describe the error.

### (a)
```python
a = 4
if a = 4:
   a + 1
print(a)
```

### (b)
```python
count = 0 
x = 3
while count < 5:
   count = count - 1
   x + 2
print(x)
```

### (c)
```python
def get_2():
   return 2

def get_3():
   return 3

print(get2 + get3)
```

### (d)
```python
x = 10
if x % 2 == 0:
   x + 5
elif x % 5 == 0:
   x - 1
else:
   x - 12
print(x)
```

### (e)
``` python
a = 5
x = a
a = a + 3
print(x, a)
```

## Problem 3
Write two different examples of a while loop that never terminates.

## Problem 2
### (a) 
Write a function called select_emotion() that takes an integer, x,  as its input, and returns:
	"ok" when x is 0
	"happy" when x is positive
	"sad" when x is negative

### (b) 
Use your newly created function within the parameters of a print() function. Print out the following sentence "I am feeling happy today."
