### Problem 1: Data Structures
1. What is the difference between a stack and queue
2. What is the difference between a linked list and a doubly-linked list. How would the Node class vary between the implementations of these two data structures?
3. What is the relationship between a dictionary and a hash function. 
4. What is a hash collision?

### Problem 2: Linked list
1. Write a Node class and use it to build a linked list with the following elements, 'a' -> 'b' -> 'c' -> 'd'
2. Create another class called Sentinel, and write a method that deletes an element the list.
3. Write a print function for the linked list.
4. Create a driver that tests your methods.

### Problem 3: Dictionaries
1. Create a dictionary that uses letter's (e.g., 'a', 'b') as keys and stores a corresponding number as a value.
2. Write a function that takes a dictionary and prints all the keys.
3. Write a function that takes a dictionary and prints all the values.
4. How would you test if a key fits into a dictionary.
